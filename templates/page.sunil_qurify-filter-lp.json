Hard water is to blame for dishes with spots, dingy looking clothes, and residue and soap scums in bathrooms. Soap and cleansers are also less effective with hard water due to its reaction to the magnesium and calcium, which makes the lather not as rich and bubbly and leaves hair feeling sticky and dull.<\/p>",
